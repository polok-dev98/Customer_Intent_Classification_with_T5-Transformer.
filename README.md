# About the project :
A Customer Intent classification system using T5 Transformer (Hugging Face) and Pytorch Lightning. Here used Bitext_Sample_Customer_Service Dataset.

1. Used Pytorch Lightning for creating DataSet, DataLoader and DataModule.

2. Used T5 TokenizerFast for creating Embeddings Vector and model inputs.

3. Used T5 Transformers for training purpose and make prediction using the trained model to the given text input.
